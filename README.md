# Fundraising Goals Analyses based on Launch date & Funding Goals
The purpose of this report is to analyze Fundraising goals data based on various data points.  
## Analyses based on Launch Date
Below chart shows there is a possible co relation between the Launch date and Outcome of a Play.  It is evident the success rate of a play launched during spring and summer months are higher than rest of the year.   There doesn’t seem to be any connection between the launch date and rate of cancelation which is steadily under 10% throughout the year. Failure rate also is steady around 40%.

Analyses based on 1 year’s historical data may not be sufficient to make decision, to further analyses trends based on Launch date,  more data is required.

## Analyses based on Funding Goals
Based on Analyses performed, there is a certain level of correlation between fundraising goal and outcome.  
Higher the goal, lower success rate
There is a higher success rate between 35,000 to 39,999 that seems to be an outlier and should not be taken into consideration
